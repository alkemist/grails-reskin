# Grails Reskin

This is an attempt to reskin the standard Grails scaffolding and index pages using HTML5 and semantic markup.

## To-do

* Complete reskinning of scaffolding
    * definition lists? Really?
    * index page aside
    * main body shouldn't be float: left
    * style error messages supplied by bean-fields and get rid of duplication at top of form
* Semantics
    * div.message and div.errors should be asides
    * article isn't used correctly, should be section
    * header should precede section not be contained within it (check this)
* Ensure everything works in IE
