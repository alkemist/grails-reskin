# Grails Reskin

This is an attempt to reskin the standard Grails scaffolding and index pages using HTML5 and semantic markup.

## To-do

* Complete reskinning of scaffolding
	* index page aside
	* bean:customField needs error class to be set on input if present (maybe do it on surrounding li)
* Ensure everything works in IE
